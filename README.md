# Quantum Transport Web Simulator

Interactive web-based simulator for coherent electronic transport in
resonant tunneling devices and molecular systems.

The platform implements:
- Tight-binding Hamiltonians
- Landauer–Büttiker formalism
- Fisher–Lee relations
- Aharonov–Bohm interference via Peierls phases
- Decoherence using the D’Amato–Pastawski model

The project is developed as both:
1. A study tool for Quantum Molecular Electronics
2. A computational presentation of exam problems on quantum transport
